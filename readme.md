# Discord Bot Demo
This project is for anyone learning Python who is looking for a good starting point for developing Discord bots.


## How to use

1. Generate your Discord bot and its token.
    - Stuck? Use the following link to learn how:
    - https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/

2. Install the latest version of Python on your system.

3. Open your command line/terminal.
    - For Windows users, use Win+R, type "cmd", then hit enter.

4. Edit main.py in your preferred text editor. *This step is important.*
    - Make sure to replace all the `#your user ID here#`s in the code with your user ID (not your tag)!
    - Otherwise, the bot will not work properly :( so you better do it!
    - Make sure to add your bot token too, otherwise it won't run at all!
    
*These next steps are all done within the terminal.*

5. Type in "pip install discord" or "pip3 install discord".
    - This installs the scripts used to be able to connect the bot to Discord.
    - You can't run the bot without it--this is what's known as a *dependency*.
    - If this doesn't work, search engines and forums are your friends.

6. Using your terminal, go to the folder that main.py is in. 
    - Stuck? Look up the cd command how-to guides.
    - Usually doing `cd Downloads` works, as you will be downloading the file.

7. Type in "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" for Linux users and hit enter.

Have fun! Go fuck yourself :)
